# Bouts de Java

Java snippets, why?

- I tried to copy from my brain memory
- I would like to add units tests with high coverage

## TODO

- [ ] Add snippets about CSV / annotations
- [ ] Add snippets to Java reflection
- [ ] Add continuous integrations
- [ ] Add coverage repports
- [ ] Check style with `spotlessCheck`
